README for Grayscale to Color Image Autoencoder
Overview
This project demonstrates an autoencoder model that converts grayscale images into color images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consists of two main parts: the Encoder and the Decoder. The Encoder compresses the grayscale input into a latent space, while the Decoder reconstructs the image in color.
